# Mini-Project.1--Data-Science-Academy
Google Analytics e Microsoft Power BI
This project was created in classes at Data Science Academy, as the subject of one of the chapters.
As I don't have an account on Microsoft Power BI Service to publish the reports (Dashboards), I used the screenshot mechanism or report export.
This dataset reflects real world problem and was provided in class by Data Science Academy.

This report (Dashboard) answer the following questions::::::::::::
1.How customers access our portal, by organic or paid search?
2.How long on average a visitor stays on our portal per day of the month?
3.What is the main source of access to our portal?
4.What is the most used device to access our portal?
5.What is the most used operating system to access our portal?
6.What is the total billing per day?
